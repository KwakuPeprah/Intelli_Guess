# 🎯 IntelliGuess

IntelliGuess is a fun and interactive number guessing game written in Python.  
The computer randomly selects a secret number, and your mission is to guess it in the fewest attempts possible.  
Choose your difficulty level, get hints along the way, and see how fast you can crack the code!

## ✨ Features
- Multiple difficulty levels:
  - Easy: Guess between 1 and 10
  - Medium: Guess between 1 and 100
  - Hard: Guess between 1 and 1000
- Input validation (handles invalid numbers and non-integer input gracefully).
- Exit option (`type 'exit'` anytime to quit).
- Replay support – play multiple rounds without restarting.
- Clean, modular project structure.
