# 🎯 IntelliGuess

IntelliGuess is a fun and interactive number guessing game written in Python.  
The computer randomly selects a secret number, and your mission is to guess it in the fewest attempts possible.  
Choose your difficulty level, get hints along the way, and see how fast you can crack the code!
